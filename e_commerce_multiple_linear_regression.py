LinearityPermalink
- This assumes that there is a linear relationship between the predictors (e.g. independent variables or features) and the response variable (e.g. dependent variable or label). This also assumes that the predictors are additive.
- Why it can happen: There may not just be a linear relationship among the data. Modeling is about trying to estimate a function that explains a process, and linear regression would not be a fitting estimator (pun intended) if there is no linear relationship.
- What it will affect: The predictions will be extremely inaccurate because our model is underfitting. This is a serious violation that should not be ignored.
- How to detect it: If there is only one predictor, this is pretty easy to test with a scatter plot. Most cases aren’t so simple, so we’ll have to modify this by using a scatter plot to see our predicted values versus the actual values (in other words, view the residuals). Ideally, the points should lie on or around a diagonal line on the scatter plot.
- How to fix it: Either adding polynomial terms to some of the predictors or applying nonlinear transformations . If those do not work, try adding additional variables to help capture the relationship between the predictors and the label.

Normality of the Error TermsPermalink
- More specifically, this assumes that the error terms of the model are normally distributed. Linear regressions other than Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) may also assume normality of the predictors or the label, but that is not the case here.
- Why it can happen: This can actually happen if either the predictors or the label are significantly non-normal. Other potential reasons could include the linearity assumption being violated or outliers affecting our model.
- What it will affect: A violation of this assumption could cause issues with either shrinking or inflating our confidence intervals.
- How to detect it: There are a variety of ways to do so, but we’ll look at both a histogram and the p-value from the Anderson-Darling test for normality.
- How to fix it: It depends on the root cause, but there are a few options. Nonlinear transformations of the variables, excluding specific variables (such as long-tailed variables), or removing outliers may solve this problem.

No Multicollinearity among PredictorsPermalink
- This assumes that the predictors used in the regression are not correlated with each other. This won’t render our model unusable if violated, but it will cause issues with the interpretability of the model.
- Why it can happen: A lot of data is just naturally correlated. For example, if trying to predict a house price with square footage, the number of bedrooms, and the number of bathrooms, we can expect to see correlation between those three variables because bedrooms and bathrooms make up a portion of square footage.
- What it will affect: Multicollinearity causes issues with the interpretation of the coefficients. Specifically, you can interpret a coefficient as “an increase of 1 in this predictor results in a change of (coefficient) in the response variable, holding all other predictors constant.” This becomes problematic when multicollinearity is present because we can’t hold correlated predictors constant. Additionally, it increases the standard error of the coefficients, which results in them potentially showing as statistically insignificant when they might actually be significant.
- How to detect it: There are a few ways, but we will use a heatmap of the correlation as a visual aid and examine the variance inflation factor (VIF).
- How to fix it: This can be fixed by other removing predictors with a high variance inflation factor (VIF) or performing dimensionality reduction.

No Autocorrelation of the Error TermsPermalink
- This assumes no autocorrelation of the error terms. Autocorrelation being present typically indicates that we are missing some information that should be captured by the model.
- Why it can happen: In a time series scenario, there could be information about the past that we aren’t capturing. In a non-time series scenario, our model could be systematically biased by either under or over predicting in certain conditions. Lastly, this could be a result of a violation of the linearity assumption.
- What it will affect: This will impact our model estimates.
- How to detect it: We will perform a Durbin-Watson test to determine if either positive or negative correlation is present. Alternatively, you could create plots of residual autocorrelations.
- How to fix it: A simple fix of adding lag variables can fix this problem. Alternatively, interaction terms, additional variables, or additional transformations may fix this.

Homoscedasticity
- This assumes homoscedasticity, which is the same variance within our error terms. Heteroscedasticity, the violation of homoscedasticity, occurs when we don’t have an even variance across the error terms.
- Why it can happen: Our model may be giving too much weight to a subset of the data, particularly where the error variance was the largest.
- What it will affect: Significance tests for coefficients due to the standard errors being biased. Additionally, the confidence intervals will be either too wide or too narrow.
- How to detect it: Plot the residuals and see if the variance appears to be uniform.
- How to fix it: Heteroscedasticity (can you tell I like the scedasticity words?) can be solved either by using weighted least squares regression instead of the standard OLS or transforming either the dependent or highly skewed variables. Performing a log transformation on the dependent variable is not a bad place to start.
