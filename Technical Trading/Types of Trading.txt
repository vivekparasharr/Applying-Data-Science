Different Types of Trading

â€‹Before we focus on technical trading, here's a review of the main 
types of equity trading:

1. Scalping: The scalper is an individual who makes dozens or hundreds 
of trades per day in an attempt to "scalp" a small profit from each trade 
by exploiting the bid-ask spread.

2. Momentum Trading: Momentum traders seek stocks that are moving 
significantly in one direction in high volume. These traders attempt to 
ride the momentum to the desired profit.

3. Technical Trading:  Technical traders focus on charts and graphs. 
They watch lines on stock or index graphs for signs of convergence or 
divergence that might indicate buy or sell signals.

4. Fundamental Trading: Fundamentalists trade companies based on fundamental 
analysis, which examines corporate events such as actual or anticipated 
earnings reports, stock splits, reorganizations, or acquisitions.

5. Swing Trading: Swing traders are fundamental traders who hold their 
positions longer than a single day. Most fundamentalists are actually 
swing traders since changes in corporate fundamentals typically require 
several days or even weeks to produce a price movement sufficient enough 
for the trader to claim a reasonable profit.

Technical Trading - Common Groups of Technical Indicators:

1. Relative Strength Index (RSI): This measures a stock's recent performance 
in relation to its historical strength by comparing the number and magnitude of 
recent and historical up and down closes. If the RSI rises above 80, this may 
indicate an overbought condition, which is a sell signal. Below 20, the RSI may 
indicate an oversold stock, which is a buy signal.

2. Range Trading:  A series of high, low, and closing prices are plotted on a 
graph for a certain period of time, and support and resistance lines are drawn 
across the bottom and top of the range. A breakout occurs when the price 
sustains a movement, even for a period or two, above or below the range.

3. Pattern Analysis: This may be the form of technical analysis that is easiest 
to understand. The same price charts discussed above are analyzed for specific 
patterns that have historically appeared in the same stock or for common patterns 
that have been seen in many stocks over time. The most commonly observed patterns 
are head-and-shoulders patterns, triangle-up or triangle-down patterns, rounded 
tops or rounded bottoms, cup-and-handle formation, and so on.

4. Trend Analysis: Highly complex and mathematical trend analysis looks at short 
and long-term trends and tries to identify crossovers, where prices cross over 
their long-term averages. The long-term averages are referred to as moving averages,
where a price range is smoothed for a period of time by averaging a series of data 
points and plotting the smoothed line against the actual price line of the stock. 
The moving average convergence divergence (MACD) is used to identify crossovers, 
divergence, and convergence, and overbought and oversold conditions.

5. Gap Analysis: A gap occurs when the opening price of a stock is significantly 
higher or lower than its closing price the previous day, possibly because of 
company news released overnight or some other factor. The gap trader is concerned 
with the performance of the stock above or below its open, which may indicate 
further movement in either direction. In this sense, the trader's decisions 
may be closer in style to that of the momentum trader than the technical analyst.

Trend Analysis - Trading Strategies

Trend traders attempt to isolate and extract profit from trends. There are 
many different trend trading strategies using a variety of technical indicators:

1. Moving Averages: These strategies involve entering into long positions when 
a short-term moving average crosses above a long-term moving average, and entering 
short positions when a short-term moving average crosses below a long-term 
moving average.

2. Momentum Indicators: These strategies involve entering into long positions 
when a security is trending with strong momentum and exiting long positions 
when a security loses momentum. Often, the relative strength index (RSI) is 
used in these strategies.

3. Trendlines & Chart Patterns: These strategies involve entering long 
positions when a security is trending higher and placing a stop-loss below 
key trendline support levels. If the stock starts to reverse, the position 
is exited for a profit.
