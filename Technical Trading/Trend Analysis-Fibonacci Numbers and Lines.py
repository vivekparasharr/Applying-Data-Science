Fibonacci Numbers and Lines
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89,144, 233, 377, and so on (each number is simply the sum of the two preceding numbers)

golden ratio of 1.618, or its inverse 0.618

In the Fibonacci sequence, any given number is approximately 1.618 times the preceding number, ignoring the first few numbers


Fibonacci sequence can be applied to finance by using four main techniques: retracements, arcs, fans, and time zones
1. Fibonacci retracement is created by taking two extreme points on a stock chart and 
dividing the vertical distance by the key Fibonacci ratios of 0%, 23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%, and 100%
Fibonacci retracement levels are horizontal lines that indicate the possible locations of support and resistance levels
Technical traders attempt to use them to determine critical points where an asset's price momentum is likely to reverse. 

61.8% is found by dividing one number in the series by the number that follows it
38.2% ratio is discovered by dividing a number in the series by the number located two spots to the right
23.6% ratio is found by dividing one number in the series by the number that is three places to the right

In addition to the ratios described above, many traders also like using the 50% level. 
The 50% retracement level is not really a Fibonacci ratio. However, traders often use it because of the tendency of 
asset prices to continue in a particular direction after a 50% retracement.

2. Fibonacci Extensions. These are horizontal lines on a chart that indicate where a strong price wave may reach.
3. Fibonacci Arcs 
4. Fibonacci Fans 
5. Fibonacci Time Zones
